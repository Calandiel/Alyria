# Frosthaven

Frosthaven was founded around TBD by [Frostfurs](../races/bunnies.md) migrating from [Bunearica](./bunearica.md). 
It is situated in the crags and fjords in the southwest of the [Isle of Dargia](./dargian_isles.md).
It is led by the pair [Isolde Frostail](../people/individuals/isolde_frostail.md) and [Alain Blufur](../people/individuals/alain_blufur.md).

Frosthaven was originally the finishing point for the Crag Walk taken by young bunnies looking to prove they had reached adulthood.
The growing population meant the walks became more frequent and a town grew. The fort built between the town and port was often seen as desecrating the festival town,
but it was now firmly the seat of power amongst the fjord clans.
