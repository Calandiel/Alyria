## Pelius' Chastisement
So, the coward runs? Craven and weak~! Had always been unFIT to Govern! Though it seems he's realized it too late...
Over the last decade, the Ruman Empire has been beseiged on all sides; Eastern Invaders, *Elven* **terror** magi, and a dozen so-called Governors who thought their obligations *null*, or worse, that ***they*** should be Emperor...
And when the empire needed him most, where did the traitor Glimmerscales send the Empire's Hero? West to the Hispanian mines? East to crush the Persian puppet? To the Shores of Afrika to secure food for the people's bellies? To Lantalia to throw back the Elven scourge? Or the Passes to halt the Bunearic advance?
No! To the North! *To fraternize with harpies and hobbits...*

Where is the Glory? 
    Shattered and broken! 
Where are the generals? 
    Plundering the land! 
Where have the orators gone? 
    Early to bed!

The people of the empire ask if their champion has abandoned them? Fled to the North to watch hobbits fish under *damp* **Rainy** ***COLD*** skies.
Where is your Roar to ease their aching hearts? Why do your scales not shimmer under the dazzling sun of the Southern sea? At the head of a thousand cohorts in Imperial livery~?
Go Now! Protector of Rum! Lest your name fade from history!
