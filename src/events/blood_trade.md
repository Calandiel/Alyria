The Blood Trade involved the mass enslavement and execution of people for use in blood magic rituals.
While primitive forms of blood magic had been used in Adanican society for millennia,
its methods were improved and had become widespread during the time of [Bathem](../people/individuals/bathem.md).
This culminated in the largest use of blood magic in history during his first attempt at apotheosis,
which saw around a quarter of a million slaves killed to fuel the ritual. 

The use of blood magic continued to be a core part of [bunny's](../races/bunnies.md) tactics in the wars that followed,
though at a much smaller scale. During the Sundering of Dargia 30 thousand slaves were sacrificed 
to shatter the anti-magic array constructed by the [Kobolds](../races/kobolds.md) of [Mountainhome](../locations/city_mountainhome.md),
after which Bunearican forces ravaged what remained of the underground city. 

The adoption of blood magic spread to Rum after its union with Bunearica in 140PB,
this process accelerated dramatically following the succession crisis of 260PB as civil war spread throughout Adanica.
To gain advantage over rivals, local warlords took advantage of blood rituals which grew in size as the wars developed.
Prohibitions on killing citizens for their blood often were ignored, and entire cities were sometimes ritualistically murdered
to perform feats of incredible magic. This allowed warlords to gain advantage over their opponents,
while also drawing a direct parallel to Bathem which was used to enhance their often shaky legitimacy. 

To match the increased demand for blood, an entire system of ‘Blood Catchers’ developed – people who captured
slaves in raids for sale to warlords. This trade dramatically escalated during the early 300s,
and resulted in the depopulation of large parts of Rum. Coastal villages were particularly affected,
as Blood Catchers raided the coasts by ship to meet demand. The result was the near total depopulation of areas
of the empire hit hardest by the Blood Catchers. 

Backlash to the Blood Trade grew, and several Bathist church councils were held to limit or ban the practice – to limited effect.
The ultimate decline came due to developments in other forms of magic during the middle 300s,
the increasing difficulty of catching slaves due to depopulation, and the lowered intensity of conflict in Adanica as states consolidated.
By the 400s the Blood Trade had declined by around 90% from its peak.
The practice was formally banned in most states following pressure from the Bathist clergy and today blood magic remains rare in Adanica outside of ceremonial uses.
