# Bunearica
The most Northwestern region on the continent of not-Europe. To the west is the ocean, the North is the [Dargian Isles](./dargian_isles.md),
the East is [The Valley](./the_valley.md) and to the South is [Yspaenela](./yspaenela.md).
It is the birthplace of the [Centaurs](../races/centaurs.md) and the [Bunnies](../races/bunnies.md).

There is a large river which runs from the southern mountains north until it splits into a wide delta at the coast.
