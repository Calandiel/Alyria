# Earshaven

Earshaven was founded around 15 BB by the [bunnies](../races/bunnies.md) who followed the [Kobold republic]() when it retreated from the greatwood in [the Valley](./the_valley.md).
A small network of fishing villages would spring up and creep inward as members of the community would begin to develop the interior, preparing it for latifundia and wolf pastures.
Small bands of Ashfurs, Bloodfurs and Frostfurs began arriving from the continent and used the city they arrived in when naming their own settlements.

It is currently led by [Lons Bentear](../people/individuals/lons_bentear.md), elected because he's an outsider, coming from one of the clans on [Scallin](../locations/dargia_scallin.md)
and being married to [Ione Warmheart](../people/individuals/ione_warmheart.md) bringing an alliance with the Ashfurs, he is seen as impartial to the infighting of the Old Guard
and pro-Elena factions in the Saltfur Fens.
