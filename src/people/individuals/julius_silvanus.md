Race: Human

Julius Silvanus was an ambitious general of [Rum](../../factions/rum.md) who was sent to [Bunearica](../../locations/bunearica.md)
to protect Ruman settlements during the [Centaur Wars](../events/centaur_wars.md). At the conclusion of the Centaur Wars, Julius would
betray Bathem beginning the [Ruman-Bunny Wars](../events/ruman_bunny_wars). He was killed by the forces of [Long Ears](./longears.md) before the sack of [Mindullum](../../locations/city_mindullum.md).
