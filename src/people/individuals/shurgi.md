# Shurgi

Deceased

Race: Human

Shurgi was the [Sarukan](../../factions/sarukan.md) Tasohim at the head of the invasion of the [Ruman Empire](../../factions/rum.md). He would wound [Bathem](./bathem.md)
in battle to the east of [Ugusta](../../locations/ugusta.md). He would cast a spell which turned the waters of not-Europe into corrupted, poisonous blood. Bathem would use
[The Heart Of An Empire](../../artifacts/the_heart_of_an_empire.md) to purify the waters and the unravelling of the spell would destroy Shurgi.
