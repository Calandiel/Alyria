# Lena "Dragon Tamer" Warmheart

Race: [Bunny (Great)](../../races/bunnies.md)

Lena was [Bathem's](./bathem.md) court druid. She was given care of the dragon egg stolen by [Rabin](./rabin.md) and would raise the dragon hatched from it, becoming the first bunny dragon rider.
Her dragon would give birth to the original wyverns the Ashfur now use as elite cavalry. She is often seen as an honorary ancestor to Ashfurs as a result. During Bathem's reign, she was sent to the
elf lands to attempt to convince the rebelling spriggans to fight the elves in order to get revenge for the [Sundeath](../events/sundeath.md). It is unclear if this succeeded in the chaos following the Sundeath.
