# Ashaven

Ashaven was located on the southern coast of the [Isle of Dargia](./dargian_isles.md). It was founded by [Ashfurs](../races/bunnies.md) arriving from the continent around TBD.

When the army of [Korgin's Rest](./city_korgins_rest.md) invaded in TBD, Ashaven was razed by the retreating Ashfurs. Its destruction has marked a noticeable downturn in attitude
from the continental bunnies towards the [kobolds](../races/kobolds.md) of Dargia. The defeat of the [bunny federation](../factions/bunny_federation.md) and the flight
to [Newhaven](./city_newhaven.md) seemed to be a metaphor for the Sundeath and would be the beginnings of the Phoenixian branch of [Bunnist-Bathism](../faiths/bathism.md).
