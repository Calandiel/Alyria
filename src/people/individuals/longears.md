# Long Ears

Deceased

Race: Bunny

Long Ears was the general sent by [Bathem](./bathem.md) to battle [Julius Silvanus](./julius_silvanus.md) for control of [Bunearica](../../locations/bunearica.md).
He defeated Julius and pushed the Rumans out of Bunearica entirely. He would then lead a campaign to weaken the Ruman Empire and repay the betrayal from the
[Centaur Wars](../../events/centaur_wars.md). It was these campaigns which marked the early years of the [Ruman-Bunny Wars]() and acquire the slaves Bathem
would use for the ritual to begin the process of apotheosis. Long Ears would be paid off by the Kobold governor of the [Valley](../../locations/the_valley.md)
to betray Bathem and disrupt the campaign to take [the city of Rum](../../locations/city_rum.md) and acquire [The Heart Of An Empire](../../artifacts/the_heart_of_an_empire.md).
He would slay [Pelius-Loud-Roar](./pelius_loud_roar.md) outside the walls of [Ugusta](../../locations/ugusta.md). He and his forces would be slain by [Rabin's](./rabin_lagoheart.md)
forces during the battle, leaving the bunny armies in tatters as the [Sarukan](../../factions/sarukan.md) Tasohim [Shurgi](./shurgi.md) would arrive from the east.
