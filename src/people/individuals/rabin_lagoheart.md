# Rabin Lagoheart

Race: Bunny

Rabin Lagoheart was a general under [Bathem](./bathem.md) who would rule Bathem's empire while Bathem sought the artifacts for his apotheosis.
He had earned Bathem's trust through many years of service as a general, though not without his failings.
He had spent a number of years leading a drug ring before being discovered and convinced to deal in less shady buisness.
During his criminal years he came into the posession of the dragon egg that would give birth to [Lena's](./lena_warmheart.md) dragon.
He would also defeat [Long Ears](./longears.md) in battle and kill him for his betrayal and assassination of the [Ruman General Pelius](./pelius_loud_roar.md).
