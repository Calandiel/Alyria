# Lena "Dragon Tamer" Warmheart

Race: [Bunny (Great)](../../races/bunnies.md)

Lena was [Bathem's](./bathem.md) court druid. During Bathem's reign, she was sent to the elf lands to attempt to convince the rebelling spriggans
to fight the elves in order to get revenge for the [Sundeath](../events/sundeath.md). It is unclear if this succeeded in the chaos following the Sundeath.

## "Dragon Tamer"
She was given the egg stolen by [Rabin](../people/individuals/rabin_lagoheart.md) to care for until it hatched and grew.
Lena would pair bond with the dragon and the two would rarely be apart for long, becoming the first bunny dragon rider.
Later in life, Lena would learn her dragon sought to reproduce and they would search for the necessary magic sources together.
Expecting the eggs to give birth to more dragons, Lena was surprised to find the offspring lacked wings and grew to be much smaller.
These Wyverns were cared for just the same and would come to be the ancestors of the wyverns that make up the elite of Ashfur cavalry.
She is often seen as an honorary ancestor to Ashfurs as a result.
