# The Heart of an Empire
The Heart of an Empire is a powerful magical artifact associated with blood magic. It manifested itself at the shrine of [Rum](../locations/city_rum.md)
as the [Ruman Empire](../factions/rum.md) grew to prominence. It was sought out by Bathem in his quest for apotheosis. Bathem used the artifact to purify
the rivers of not-Europe after the [Sarukan](../factions/sarukan.md) Tasohim [Shurgi](../people/individuals/shurgi.md) made them flow with corrupted, poisonous blood.
