# Kobolds
Small scaled humanoids that stand about 2/3rds the height of a man. Kobolds are one of the native races of Adanica, and have existed alongside humans, bunnies, and elves for milennia. Traditionally kobolds have favored styles of government based on a consensus of elder leaders. Before the time of [Bathem](..people/individuals/bathem.md) Kobolds were dispersed across Adanica. Most Kobolds were part of tribes, often organized on the basis of scale color. These colors were core to identity, but how exactly they manifested varied between groups. Some stricter tribes made scale color a requirement for full participation in society, either expelling those of other colors, or creating a hierarchical system based on color. Others treated color more symbolically, either by allowing Kobolds (or other races) with the 'wrong' scale color to paint their scales, or by ritually changing ones color if they met certain conditions. 

This practice began to die out during the period from ~300 BB - 0BB. In most of Adanica this was due to the conquest of dozens of Kobold tribes by the expanding Ruman Empire. The humans of Rum had little interest in scale color, and attempted to stamp out the practice to reduce conflict between their Kobold subjects. Multiple decrees were passed outlawing color discrimination over the centuries, though the mere existance of so many decrees proves that they must not have been completely successful. The other major event was the conclusion of the Color Wars (-90BB - -53BB) in They Valley, which contained the largest concentration of Kobolds in Adanica. During this period conflict between Kobold and Human tribes intensified in The Valley. The pressure of war lead to the creation of a major tribal confederacy that united various Humans and Kobolds under the 'All-Colored Council'. This council forbid the practice of color discrimination and created the beginnings of centralized government in The Valley. The tribes still practicing color discrimination were defeated and absorbed into the council. 

During the time of Bathem, the All-Colored Council became dominated by the one-man rule of [Glimmerscale](..people/individuals/glimmerscale.md), who integrated much of The Valley into the Ruman Empire.
