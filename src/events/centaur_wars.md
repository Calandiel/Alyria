# The Centaur Wars

The Centaur Wars denote a six year period in [Bunearica](../locations/bunearica.md) which saw the [Centaur](../races/centaurs.md) society destroyed and those centaurs who remained enslaved.
It's conclusion marks the beginning of the [Ruman-Bunny Wars]().

The period began with the seven great centaur warbands launching a series of increasingly bold and ambitious raids into the lands occupied by [bunnies](../races/bunnies.md) and [humans](../races/humans.md).
Unfortunately for the Centaurs, they provoked [Rum](../factions/rum.md) into sending the ambitious and veteran general [Julius Silvanus](../people/individuals/julius_silvanus.md) to pacify [Bunearica](../locations/bunearica.md) and protect the Ruman settlements
(and bring non-Ruman settlements into Rum's sphere). At the same time, [Bathem's](../people/individuals/bathem.md) unification of the bunnies had concluded and bunnies now provided a united front.
The Rumans had only come to conquer and the Bunnies to protect themselves, but with three warbands broken and routed the remaining Centaurs rallied behind
[Abaga of the Blackwood](../people/individuals/abaga.md) and prepared to take back all they had lost.
In retribution for their earlier losses, the Centaurs burned, raped and pillaged dozens if not hundreds of villages.
Abaga used the centaurs' speed to dart between Julius' and Bathem's armies, defeating them in detail.

While this advantage lasted the better part of a year, Bathem and Julius had used the time to fill their forces with cavalry,
and having allied with each other, Abaga's advantage fell away. The two armies then set about the systematic destruction of the Centaurs.
For three years they herded the Centaurs west, raiding and overrunning Centaur tribes along the way.
They drove the Centaurs back to the coast where Bathem and Julius met and agreed to finish the Centaurs off together.
The Ruman general had other plans though, attacking in the night he would slaughter the remaining Centaurs
before turning and attacking the bunny forces who had only barely woken with the dawn. Though the Centaurs would never again lead their own society,
the betrayal of the bunnies by the Rumans would begin the conflict that would shatter the Ruman Empire.
