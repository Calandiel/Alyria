# Elena Redears

Race: [Bunny (Bloodfur)](../../races/bunnies.md)

Elena Redears is the leader of the Bloodfurs on [Dargia](../../locations/dargian_isles.md). She came to power following the [Battle of Decestire Pass]() which stopped
the invasion of the [Bunny Federation](../../factions/bunny_federation.md). She is a descendant of one of [Bathem's](./bathem.md) children.

Many bunnies on Dargia believe if they are to be reunited under one banner it will be under her reign.
