# The Flight of the Ashfurs

The Flight of the Ashfurs occurred during the war between the [Bunny Federation](../factions/bunny_federation.md) and [Korgin's Rest](../locations/city_korgins_rest.md).
The city of [Ashaven](../locations/city_ashaven.md) was beseiged by Korgin forces when a breakout was staged. The retreating [Ashfurs](../races/bunnies.md) would use their magic
to burn the city to the ground to prevent its capture. The survivors would negotiate with the Saltfurs to settle in a sparsely inhabited area on the [Isle of Brinscomb](../locations/dargia_brinscomb.md).
There they would establish the new settlement of [Newhaven](../locations/city_newhaven.md).
