# The Endowment of the Bunnies
The Endowment of the Bunnies is the period of time between the recreation of [The-Flames-Of-The-Sun](../artifacts/the_flames_of_the_sun.md) and [Bathem's](../people/individuals/bathem.md) apotheosis and ascension to the [God Realm](../locations/god_realm.md).
Bathem travelled throughout his empire, from the largest cities to the smallest manors, giving each [bunny](../races/bunnies.md) he encountered a blessing from one of his aspects.
Over the following centuries, the unified bunny tribe which had followed Bathem would fracture into the three major tribes based on the blessing their ancestors received: [Ashfurs](), [Frostfurs]() and [Bloodfurs]().
