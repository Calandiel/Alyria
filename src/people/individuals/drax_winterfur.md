## Drax Winterfur
Also know as "Drax Redfur" by his opponents. 
(273 AB - 321 AB) 

Drax Winterfur was a Rumish noble bunny hailing from Bunearica. Born to a minor family amid a period of increasing instability, Drax is known to have made his fortune as a 'robber lord', a noble who raided Rumish citizens for profit. Effectively a bandit, Drax managed to avoid punishment through clever political manuevers, which saw him support a series of weak pretenders to the Rumish throne -- pretenders he often betrayed when their position collapsed. Drax rose to prominence after leading an army to defeat a golem invasion of southern Bunearica in 306. Shortly after he declared himself 'Emperor of Bunearica" and began a campaign to unite the province. 

At the time Bunearica had been devastated by invasion, resulting in it's division between several rival Rumish and Golem warlords. After several failed campaigns from 308-313, Drax turned to blood magic to gain the upper hand. While the sacrifice of slaves was common by this period, the practice had mostly wiped out the slave populations of Western Rum. Drax instead turned to Rumish citizens. At first this involved raids over land or sea to capture people from rival territories, but by 316 Drax began implimenting a 'blood tax', which forced settlements deemed 'disloyal' to grant him a certain number of citizens for sacrifice in blood rituals. These efforts paid off, and by 219, three quarters of Bunearica was controlled by Drax.

Efforts to turn the blood tax into a regularly assessed measure (set at 1% of a settlements population per year) sparked revolt across Bunearica. The "Revolt of a Million Ears", as it came to be known, threw his realm into chaos. Despite some early victories over the peasant rebels, they were soon joined by nobles opposed to Drax's rule. In 321 Drax's army was defeated soundly at the Battle of Tribica. Drax was killed while trying to flee the battle, and his realm fragmented.
