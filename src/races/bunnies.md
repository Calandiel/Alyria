# Bunnies

## Military
Bunny militaries are comprised of the cavalry and the infantry. They are organized into Banners, Lances and Squadrons.
After the rise of Bathem, bunny militaries are formed around a core of clan retinue cavalry supplemented by infantry levies and auxiliaries.
Before Bathem cavalry wasn't used and the militaries were primarily spearmen and archers.

### Banner
- ~1000 soldiers or all lances available
- lead by a clanhead
- infantry and/or cavalry
### Lance
- ~100 soldiers
- lead by a clanhead or favored child
- infantry OR cavalry
### Squadrons
- ~10 soldiers
- lead by a veteran or favored child
- infantry OR cavalry

## Infantry
Bunny infantry is primarily made up of spearmen and bowmen. Mixed formations are common with bowmen
firing while the enemy closes before retreating behind their spearmen. Some formations consist of
soldiers carrying both bows and spears, switching between them as needed on the battlefield.

### Spearmen
Bunny spearmen primarily use Spears, Pikes, and Halberds. Shields were rare in early bunny formations,
often only being in the first line or two. As combat with other races became more common so did the use of shields.
By 300, it was common to see entire formations of shield carrying spearmen. By 700, most spearmen carry a round shield,
pikemen and halberdiers preferring smaller bucklers.

### Bowmen
Unlike other races, bunnies do not use their arms in their traditional archery.
Instead they perform a handstand before drawing the bow using their stronger legs.
This causes masses of bowmen to take up more space, carry fewer projectiles and
individual bowmen have worse sightlines on their targets than an arm-bow formation.
The advantage however is the much larger projectile, more akin to a small javelin than an arrow,
and with the stopping power to match. The ratio of arm-bows to leg-bows in armies shifts over time
though periods of decay tend to see leg-bows take the lead.

## Cavalry
Bunny cavalry armaments largely mirror their infantry. Generally they carry a lance for the initial charge,
a few javelins to throw during the approach and a shorter spear for the melee.
Some riders replace their javelins with arm-bows. The riders of the Western peninsula even train in shooting their leg-bows while mounted,
though they sacrifice a great deal of armor for the privilege. Cavalrymen began to adopt round shields in line with their infantry, but
they found the shields to be unwieldy and would replace them with smaller bucklers.

### Wolfriders
"If Elves are so wise, how come I've made a kebab of three on my spear?" -A wolf rider from the 317th squadron of the 102nd
lance of the 57th banner, led by the nephew of Bathem's fourth-cousin in-law thrice-removed.

Bathem taught the bunnies how to ride wolves after returning from the frost fields and they would use the skill
to defeat the [Centaurs](../events/centaur_wars.md). Wolfriding became the primary choice of occupation for landowners,
clanheads and their families during war, is a nobleman who doesn't ride even a nobleman?
The worst part of facing a wolfrider is the choice between fending off the wolf's snapping canines or the rider's spear. 

The wolves ridden live to around 15 years old, though many are unfit for combat by 10 years.
As a result the wolves are treated as tools, a rider may have a favorite, but going through a few wolves during a riders career is expected.
This is unlike the Wyvernriders who pair bond with their wyvern.

### Dragonriders
There has only been one bunny dragon rider, [Lena "Dragontamer" Warmheart](../people/individuals/lena_warmheart.md).
She was given the egg stolen by [Rabin](../people/individuals/rabin_lagoheart.md) to care for until it hatched and grew.
Lena would pair bond with the dragon and the two would rarely be apart for long.
Later in life, Lena would learn her dragon sought to mate and they would search for another dragon.
Though the dragon they found was able to breed, it seems the two were different species as the offspring lacked wings
and grew to be much smaller. They were cared for just the same and would come to be the ancestors of the wyverns
that make up the elite of [Ashfur]() cavalry.

### Wyvernriders / Dragoons
The Wyvernriders ride the descendants of Lena's dragon in battle. Though the wyverns are rarer and slower,
they possess heightened strength and their scales provide increased protection, compared to a wolf. 
The wyverns are also able to spit fire. The Wyvernriders have come to be the elite of Ashfur cavalry units.

Because wyverns are much stronger than a wolf, a wyvern is able to carry 2-4 bunnies on its back.
While extremely awkward to fight in this arrangement, it is often used to ferry 2-3 infantry quickly across the battle field
before they dismount. The dismounted infantry have come to be known as dragoons.

The Wyverns of [Dargia](../locations/dargian_isles.md) have also learned to swim and fish and some adventurous riders began to experiment
with using them in naval engagements around 300 PB.
