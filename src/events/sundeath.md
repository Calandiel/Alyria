# Sundeath
The Sundeath occurred when [Aelys Frostkeep](../people/individuals/aelys_frostkeep.md) commanded the destruction of [The Flames of the Sun](../artifacts/the_flames_of_the_sun.md).
The Sun began to dim over the following decade causing (i dont know what to put here).
It concluded when [Bathem](../people/individuals/bathem.md) recreated The Flames of the Sun and the Sun began to shine again.
