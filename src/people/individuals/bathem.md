## Bathem's Rising
From what we can tell, Bathem was born to a minor clan and trained as a warrior.
He became clanless as a young adult, likely from his clan being destroyed in war.
He would be taken in by the Wolfspear clan[^1] along the Northeast coast of Bunearica.
His clan fought with another during a particularly cold winter.
At the end of a battle, he stood shivering while looking out at the sea.
The cold sea winds buffeting his blood soaked body.
The winter's chill had frozen the sea. He walked out onto the ice until he reached the Northern peninsula.
He never spoke of what happened during this journey but, he returned with a bloody vengeance.
Newly armed with magics and his famed wolf, known now as Centaur's bane.

[^1]: The Wolfspear clan was originally known as the Shorthopper clan, but they were the first to learn to ride wolves on Bathem's return and made it their namesake to honor him.

The Wolfspear Saga describes the event:
"The Bunaeric clans are as old as the storytellers' consensus can remember.
But the clan feuds had boiled over and the bickering turned to war.
The fields lay fallow, our stomachs and wombs empty.
Until the hero Bathem returned from the frost fields with a clear mind and visions of the future.
When the elders balked at his words, he cut them down and the clan became his followers.
Those who saw the vision joined with him. The other clans' bickering continued,
and Bathem cut down the elders until his fur no longer resembled the snow,
until there was only Bathem, his followers and the leaderless.
The tribal ties had been severed, the obligations absolved.
A gathering of all the clans was called, and Bathem would tell them his vision.
Tomorrow's stories would not look like Yesterday's."

He trained the bunnies to ride wolves, which we mastered during the [Centaur Wars](../../events/centaur_wars.md).
He appointed [Long Ears](./longears.md) to lead a grand host against the Rumans after their betrayal, while he led another host east to tame the [Valley](../../locations/the_valley.md).

## Bathem's Saga
```
1. Rising
My banners waved and my spears gleamed, 
From Gentle-Green bloody rivers streamed. 
Our bellies and wombs were full again, 
While General Long Ears fought the humen. 
And between Two Crowns of magic wood, 
With great effort our new capital stood.

2. Ascension
Long Ears returned with salt and plunder. 
We celebrated and grew great in number. 
And sons of the South were torn asunder. 
Under headsman's axe their blood did splash, 
Causing their crops to turn to ash. 
My fur soaked red, I stared into the divine. 
The ritual malfunctioned through foreign design, 
But with three artifacts united, 
God-hood would be mine.

3. Southwards
Pelius was convinced with salt well-cured, 
With Gaul and the Passes secured, 
Rabin marched from where Mindullum burned. 
While Leena sought to see the Spriggans turned.

4. Betrayal
They struck at the heart of an Empire fractured, 
But under Kobold coin was Long Ears enraptured. 
Before the walls of Ugusta, Pelius made his death groan, 
And with the blood of the traitors the fields were sown.

5. Descent
In tandem, the water-dragons struck at our back porch, 
And Sarukan saw Eastern Rum put to the torch. 
With my power great, I stood against their dread lich. 
But I was bested in battle and nearly died in a ditch.

6. Quest
Infighting and arrogance had returned us to folly. 
And so I conspired with Rabin to break this melancholy. 
I alone, sought The-Heart-Of-An-Empire. 
And in the shrine South of Rum, found my heart's desire.

7. Famine
The Kobolds and Elves behind sea and wood did cower, 
When Sarukan used their infernal power, 
To fill the rivers with blood of poisonous intent. 
Through trade, Rabin cooled the Kobolds without malcontent.

8. Restoration
And so I returned battered and muddied, 
To the ritual grounds I went where I made my hands bloodied. 
And held aloft The-Heart-Of-An-Empire, 
For my people's situation was incredibly dire. 
The rivers became pure and no longer brought demise, 
And once again I was a hero in my people's eyes.

9. Calamity
Joined by Tevi we sailed on Kobold ships,
to the place on the sea where the land finally dips.
Together we opened the gates at Salatun,
And there we beheld The-Chill-Of-The-Moon.
But taking it in hand, we felt a great shudder,
And rushing out we saw as the sun began to sputter.

## Bathem's Saga Context
Each line corresponds to the same line in the saga.
```
1. Rising
Bathem arrives in the Valley at the head of a great host
The fort-city of Gentle-Green became a battlefield of bunnies vs elves, humen, and kobolds
The spoils of war fed our fertility festival +30k population
Long Ears fought an off-map campaign against the humans in Gaul
The elves used magic to create a wall of magic woods
Bathem built his capital in a gap between the magic wood

2. Ascension
Self-explanatory
Another fertility festival was held +98k population
Ruman's were taken as slaves and used for blood rituals
Over 300k Ruman's were sacrificed for the 3 great rituals, the first ritual was a blizzard to weaken Gentle-Green
The second ritual destroyed the crops of the Empire to prepare it for another invasion
The third ritual saw Bathem use 250,000 Ruman sacrifices to acquire divinity
Elven terror-mages and Kobold anti-mages worked against the completion of the ritual
Though the ritual wasn't successful, Bathem became a demi-god, to complete his ascension he would need to retrieve three artifacts related to the magics the bunnies practice: ash, frost, and blood

3. Southwards
Pelius was a kobold varangian who fought for the Rumans in the past, he was convinced to join the bunnies to rebuild the Ruman empire
Gaul and the Passes are the Imperial provinces to the West and South-West of the Valley where the saga begins.
Long Ears sacked and burned Mindullum at the Southern edge of the Passes during his campaign, Rabin was Bathem's second in command
The Elven terror-mages created wooden golems to bolster their numbers, but a group had broken away. Leena was Bathem's court druid and had become a dragon rider and so was sent to convince the wayward golems to fight the Elves

4. Betrayal
Pelius and Rabin defeated the warlord of Hispania on their way to Rum
Long Ears was bribed by the Kobolds to murder Pelius for his betrayal
Long Ears fought the forces of Rabin and Pelius and killed Pelius in combat
But Rabin defeated Long Ears' force and killed his fellow general

5. Descent
The Kobolds had colonized the isle of Britonne and launched a naval expedition in the northern delta of the great river of Gaul, exploiting bunnies' lack of knowledge of ships
The Sarukan empire defeated the warlord of Eastern Rum and reached the border with the bunnies on their way to Rum
Bathem believed with his demi-god powers and the combined might of all his armies he could defeat the Sarukan and seize Rum where the blood artifact lay
But his armies had been weakened by infighting and the efforts of the kobolds and elves and he was defeated

6. Quest
Before the events of the game the bunnies were weak due to division and infighting, Bathem had united them under one banner
Rabin was placed in charge of the bunnies while Bathem went away to seek the blood artifact
The-Heart-Of-An-Empire was the artifact representing bunny blood magic
Securing the heart would once again see Bathem's power enhanced

7. Famine
The defeat of Bathem and the bunny horde made the Kobolds and Elves turn their attention towards Sarukan
Self-explanatory
The spell turned the waters of the rivers into poisonous blood causing a great famine to sweep the lands
With the collapse of the empire, the kobolds no longer saw a reason to be enemies with Bathem and his bunnies and traded the delta back in exchange for trading rights

8. Restoration
There's only 3 lines of context it was mostly prose
Bathem's popularity had fallen greatly because of his defeat and so was unaided by his people
Bathem used his power and the artifact to cleanse the rivers of all the lands
Which restored his people's faith in him

9. Calamity
Tevi Cottontail was a member of an early cult centered around worshipping Bathem before Bathism was founded.
They sailed to the western most point of the continent where The Chill Of The Moon was found.
The expedition had to spend weeks opening the magical ice gate of the shrine.
The Chill Of The Moon was taken by Bathem.
When Bathem took it in his hand, Aelys Frostkeep ordered the destruction of The Flames Of The Sun beginning the Sundeath.
