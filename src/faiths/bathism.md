# Bathism

Bathism is the faith of those who worship Bathem.

It is often fractured based on which race the followers believe Bathem was.

- Bunnist-Bathism believes Bathem was a [Bunny](../races/bunnies.md).
	-	Phoenixian-Bathism is a splinter which believes Bathem wages a war in the [God Realm](../locations/god_realm.md) and will return to lead the bunnies.
- Humanist-Bathism believes Bathem was a [Human](../races/humans.md), also known as Turentism.
- Elven-Bathism believs Bathem was an [Elf](../races/elves.md).
- Koboldian-Bathism believes Bathem was a [Bunny](../races/bunnies.md), but believe that efforts to oppose his apotheosis by [Glimmerscale](../people/individuals/glimmerscale.md) were essential to shaping him.
