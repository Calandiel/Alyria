# Bloodshaven

Bloodshaven was founded by the [Bloodfurs](../races/bunnies.md) who created the first great Latifundia in western [Dargia](./dargian_isles.md), growing in influence as the continental bunnies tamed the islands wildlands.
It is currently led by the [Lady Elena Redears](../people/individuals/elena_redears.md).
